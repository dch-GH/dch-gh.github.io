I first had the idea to make my own site (specifically as a portfolio piece) around April of 2023.
When I set about on the project, I had a hard time picking a framework. My experience in webdev is (thankfully) pretty limited. In the past, I‚Äôve heard jokes/opinions of other people lamenting
the abundance of frameworks and then I very suddenly understood their pain.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-gi3nxu">There are <strong>actually</strong> too many options. I just wanted a basic static site to put stuff on and say ‚Äúhere‚Äôs what I‚Äôve worked on‚Äù. This framework, that framework, you need to use
Vue components, React components, JSX, Next.js, Nuxt.js, compile this yourself, etc. COMPONENTS, COMPONENTS!! It was just very overwhelming- especially when you consider that all I‚Äôve known up until that point
is old-school HTML, JS, CSS. So, that‚Äôs what I ended up opting for.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-e5xh08">I tried to make my website with the most basic tools possible: just VSCode + HTML/JS/CSS. Then I realized making it look good and act <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design/" rel="nofollow">responsive</a>
was way harder than I had guessed (go figure). So, I caved a little bit and used <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" rel="nofollow">Bootstrap</a>. This library essentially gives you some premade CSS classes to work with.
This wasn‚Äôt a bad decision, it did mostly all I wanted it to do. The problem is I still
wound up manually writing way more HTML than I should have. Also, responsive doesn‚Äôt mean what you think it means unless you are already in the know. Responsive means how well the site adjusts to other devices, display sizes, etc,
not the literal millisecond responsiveness of the website.
Webdev is filled with terms that don‚Äôt
accurately represent their meaning. Try to guess what ‚Äúslug‚Äù means in the context of webdev.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1qzrv17"><strong>Take a look at this:</strong></p> <pre class="language-html"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class="language-html"><span class="token comment">&lt;!-- MIR --></span>

Now, multiply that by all the projects and any other info boxes I wanted to add.</strong></p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1dz3zat">I do think it turned out better than it could‚Äôve if I had chosen not to use Bootstrap, but it‚Äôs still pretty bad.
It was a stark contrast to what I‚Äôve been a bit spoiled by: <a href="https://sbox.game/" rel="nofollow">s&amp;box</a>‚Äôs Razor UI. Basically, s&amp;box lets you use Razor in the same way you would when writing
an ASP.Net Razor/Blazor, except to make UI for your games. Considering that I‚Äôd been using this for about 2 years, I got used to it! So, throughout this whole
journey I‚Äôm dying to just use Razor so I can interweave C#, HTML, and CSS in the same file to construct a page. Apparently there are some <a href="https://github.com/ZarehD/AspNetStatic" rel="nofollow">ways</a>, but I still find them a bit
overly complicated for my purposes and annoying to set up.</p> <hr> <h1 data-svelte-h="svelte-1vr02r4">The framework in question:</h1> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-z2e5la">Today I was determined to use one of these fancy frameworks or tools and make the website properly.
I was going to give <a href="https://gohugo.io/" rel="nofollow">Hugo</a> another shot, then considered <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" rel="nofollow">11ty</a>, but a few people I know really enjoyed using <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/" rel="nofollow">Sveltekit</a>.
I wanted to try this one since it seems to receive universal praise. This is actually the second time I‚Äôm writing this part of the post since originally, a few days ago, I had made the site using Astro.
Astro was really easy to understand, set up and get going with but I wanted just a bit more flexibility. Sveltekit definitely gives you that at the cost of a bit more complexity.
So today (July 5th 2024) I‚Äôm finishing up the website <strong>again</strong> after spending the last couple days rewriting the site using Sveltekit and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" rel="nofollow">Tailwind</a>. The docs for Sveltekit are ‚Äúgood‚Äù but
as usual with a lot of frameworks leave a lot desired in my opinion. The verdict is that I think if you need something that can scale a bit in the range of ‚Äúrelatively simple needs‚Äù, Astro can definitely work for you.</p> <h1 data-svelte-h="svelte-8gxl63">Why?</h1> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1cwdr3n">The driving motivation this time around is mostly to have my own devblogs. I <strong>love</strong> devblogs. I‚Äôve read <em>every</em> <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/" rel="nofollow">Factorio Blog</a>, some of them multiple times out of desperation since nothing else comes close.
Another one I‚Äôve enjoyed is <a href="http://clarkkromenaker.com/" rel="nofollow">Clark Kromenaker</a>‚Äòs. He‚Äôs re-implenting this engine for a heavily data-oriented game called Gabriel Knight 3. It‚Äôs really satisfying.
I obviously can‚Äôt list all the ones I‚Äôve read, but it got to the point where I was wishing there were a good aggregator specifically for devblogs. Reddit seems like the obvious answer to this, but I tried that. Maybe I didn‚Äôt look hard enough.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ixc38n">I especially enjoy the ones that somehow perfectly balance being technical without being as boring as a whitepaper about rocks or something.
I can only hope to hit that balance myself, but I want my own devblog too. I started working on a game at the end of May and I want to finish this one. I‚Äôve had a bad habit of tinkering but never finishing stuff.
I <em>did</em> finish a game jam project for the first time in November of last year, but I‚Äôll probably give that experience its own post instead.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ltfijh">I want to see what it‚Äôs like to write devblogs for a game you are actively developing.
Maybe having devblogs to look forward to showing off progress on can help maintain motivation as well.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-typbs6">Of course, it‚Äôs not <em>that</em> simple. Never let this Yahtzee Croshaw image leave your mind:
<img src="/posts/gamedev.png" alt="image">
This has been the first time that proper bugs have actually cropped up unexpectedly in a project of mine because there‚Äôs actually enough code at play they can pop up in.
So, I guess that‚Äôs strangely a good sign.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ti4iyf">Anyway, thanks for reading.</p></article></div></div>
